# GLASST-Outputs
Brings together outputs of the GLASS project implemented from 2018 to 2025 [say more on GLASST]

A significant output of the GLASST project was to advance models for the assessment of the health impacts of urban transport

We focused on two modelling approaches: the Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) approach and the Multi-Stage Life Table (MSLT) approach

1. Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) Approach
The CRA approach to health impact modelling systematically evaluates and compares the risks posed by different hazards or interventions...

We have made advancements in two models that use the CRA approach: ITHIM Global Version 1 (single day-long travel data) and ITHIM Global Version 2 (Week-long travel data)

1.1 ITHIM Global Version 1 (daylong travel data)
- This model builds on older ITHIM versions that take inputs as a single day travel behaviour. We advanced this model in the following ways:
 - Use of new PA DRF with different cut-off points 
 - 
	
1.2 ITHIM Global Version 2 (Weeklong travel data)
- This model addresses the one-day travel data limitations of ITHIM Global Version 1...
 - It allows for a reduced number of inputs
 - Takes a week-long travel data generated through machine-learning predictions
 - parametrised PA data generation   

2. MSLT Approach

3. Uncertainty and Value of Information (VoI) analysis
